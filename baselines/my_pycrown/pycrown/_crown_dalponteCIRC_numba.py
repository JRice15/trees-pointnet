    Crown delineation based on Dalponte and Coomes (2016) and
    lidR R-package (https://github.com/Jean-Romain/lidR/)
    In contrast to the moving window growing scheme from the original algorithm
    this code implements a circular region growing around the tree top which
    leads to smoother crown patterns and speeds up the calculation by one order
    of magnitude

    Parameters
    ----------
    Chm :       ndarray
                Canopy height model as n x m raster
    Trees :     ndarray
                Tree top pixel coordinates as nx2 ndarray
    th_tree :   float
                Threshold below which a pixel cannot be a tree. Default 2
    th_seed :   float
                Growing threshold 1. A pixel is added to a region if its height
                is greater than the tree height multiplied by this value. It
                should be between 0 and 1. Default 0.45
    th_crown :  float
                Growing threshold 2. A pixel is added to a region if its height
                is greater than the current mean height of the region
                multiplied by this value. It should be between 0 and 1.
                Default 0.55.
    max_crown : float
                Maximum value of the crown diameter of a detected tree (in
                pixels). Default 10
